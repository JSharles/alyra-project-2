# Objectives

The purpose of this test coverage is to cover as much of the codebase as possible based on three key points:

- Is the contract functional?
- Is the contract secure?
- Is the contract optimized in terms of gas consumption?

## Checklist to complete :

- [x] Add a `describe` block for each function
- [x] Add a `it` block for each instruction related to those functions (it should include modifiers)
- [ ] Create a mock contract with different types of memory allocation (less optimized)
- [ ] Test gas consumption by comparing it with the mock contract
- [ ] Test variable and function visibility
